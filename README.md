This is my new project! 
My goal is the create a Mutiplayer Crossover Card Game, with RPG mechanics.

The base gameplay will be rather similar to Labyrinth of Touhou 2 with some differences.

Instead of filling an action bar, SPD will be used simular to D&D intuitive. 
There's no need for a ATK or MAG stat because there's no basic attack option.
When dodging an attack roll a d10 and compare EVA. Higher, it hits. Lower or equal, is misses. ACC lowers EVA. 
DEF and RES block damage from ATK and MAG skills respectively.
SP is the cost for skills.
HP is health and determines whether a unit is KO'ed or not.


I'm looking for Character Ideas and Card Design help.
Character Ideas can be put in issues with the idea label.
Card Design will mostly be puting the stats on the cards. 
Not that exciting but someone's got to do it.
