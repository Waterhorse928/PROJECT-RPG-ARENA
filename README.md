This is my new project! 
My goal is the create a Mutiplayer Crossover Card Game, with RPG mechanics.
The base gameplay will be rather similar to Labyrinth of Touhou 2 with some differences.
I'm looking for Character Ideas and Card Design help.
Character Ideas can be put in issues with the idea label.
Card Design will mostly be puting the stats on the cards. 
Not that exciting but someone's got to do it.
